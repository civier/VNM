# Convert large Docker container to Singularity container
###########################################################
# 
# USAGE:
# bigdocker2singularity <output.sif> <docker container tag> <docker container version>
#

# NOTES:
# - must make sure that root has enough room for docker image, as image will be constructed in /var/tmp
# described here: https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/1537
# - For some reason, singulatiry does not read SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR, and generate cache at /root/.singularity (if no space there, can download docker image to a tar file, and run everything from a normal user)
# - The first stage of "INFO:	starting build..." is very slow
# - The last stage of "INFO:	Creating SIF file..." is very slow
# - fix-perms is required so I have permission to write file when running with --writable-tmpfs

mkdir tmp
