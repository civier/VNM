Virtual Neuro Machine

With the advent of container technology, cumbersome virtual machines have been reduced to a single container file that can be easily run on multiple-environments. Containers can be run both interactively (e.g., within a Virtual Machine on the cloud) and in batch processing (e.g., on HPC), thus contributing to reproducibility across stages of the analysis. The goal of this project is to generate a "virtual neuro machine" container, i.e. a large container that includes most popular neuroimaging tools, and can be used as a stand-alone VM. Although tools to generate neuroimaging software containers are already in place (e.g., neurodocker), continued maintenance of such a large container with complex library dependencies requires in-built testing capabilities, and especially so, of included GUI applications. This project will bring together people working on different environments and using different neuroimaging tools, in order to: 1) build a working container with the newest software versions available in June 2020, 2) develop in-built testing capabilities, to facilitate future container upgrades, 3) develop a standard "home screen" for the container, to provide common interface across host environments.
